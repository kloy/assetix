# Assetix

A simple wrapper for easily using Assetic. Project is still in heavy development, but the
end goal is to provide a simple way for including assets and letting Assetic build and
cache them in production.

Assetix uses [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) for including Assetic. Follow the steps
at [Packagist](http://packagist.org/) if you are unfamiliar with composer to get going.
